## 关于气球使用的Reviews
Beautiful balloons. Some tips....
I bought this by November, but I filled one with helium just a few days ago. It look awesome. I could be upset since the balloon had 2 small holes, but the girl who filled it out put some transparent tape and it worked just perfect. So we were good on that.
How much helium you will need: the balloons are 36" (3ft) or 90 cm fully inflated. You will need 15 cubic feet or 0.425 cubic meters. We used liquid glue to make the confetti stick to the balloon. YES, you have to filled the confetti by yourself (not really sure why so many complains with this), and YES is perfectly round, if you don't get the round shape is because you need more helium. I put tissue tassels, it look incredible with a much lower expense. I am happy with the purchase.
